## Introduction

RAG is one of the most coveted use cases nowadays for AI. The great thing about RAG is that it allows you to augment the knowledge of an LLM without having to retrain it. How, you may ask? Well, it's a way for the LLM to extract information (like a database) and present this information to the user very quickly.

This allows LLMs to acquire up-to-date knowledge, for example, the results of this year's SuperBowl, regardless of when the LLM you're running inference against has been trained. Therefore, you can make your LLM more intelligent and provide it with updated data with little to no effort.

Luckily, OCI GenAI Agents Service allows us to do just that: we will be able to upload our documents, process this data, put it into a Vector Store (OCI OpenSearch), create a Redis cluster for caching purposes, and provide users with a way to **consume** this data through a chatbot!

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Generative AI Agents (Beta) is a fully managed service that combines the power of large language models with an intelligent retrieval system to create contextually relevant answers by searching your knowledge base, making your AI applications smart and efficient.

To use this service, index your data in OCI Search with OpenSearch and set up a cluster in OCI Cache with Redis for the cached user prompts and responses. Then you create an agent and attach your data source. Finally, you test your agent and allow it to generate insights and answer questions. We will see how to do all these steps in this application pattern.

### Use Cases

Use the OCI Generative AI Agents service for the following types of use cases:

- Chatbot for FAQs: Index FAQ and documentation so that users can easily access relevant topics and find answers to their questions through a chatbot or through the current documentation.
- Chatbot for policies: Index policy documents, such as human resources, insurance, or finance documents. When users ask specific questions about these policies, they can get answers relevant answers from those documents through a chatbot interface.

### Available Regions in OCI with the Generative AI Agents Service

Oracle hosts its OCI services in regions and availability domains. A region is a localized geographic area, and an availability domain is one or more data centers in that region. OCI Generative AI Agents is hosted in the following region:

- Region name: US Midwest (Chicago)
- Region identifier: `us-chicago-1`

## 0. Prerequisites and setup

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Account with available credits to spend
- [Appropriate policies for the GenAI Agents Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai-agents/iam-policies.htm#policies) set up properly within your tenancy
- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Documentation - Generative AI Agents](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai-agents/overview.htm#overview)
- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI - Getting Started](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai-agents/getting-started.htm#get-started)
- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI - API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/generative-ai-agents/20240331/)
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
- [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
- [OCI SDK](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)
- You must have the Chicago region in your tenancy. Generative AI Agents is only available in Chicago.
- You must have an Identity Domain before you create an agent. [Follow the steps here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai-agents/getting-started.htm#prereq-domain) to create an Identity Domain within your OCI Account.

Instead of doing the whole infrastructure deployment manually (which includes Cache with Redis and OCI Search with OpenSearch) you can deploy both things with the following [Terraform stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai-agents/create-stack.htm#create-stack):

1. Download the [prerequisite stack zip file](https://idem3zoqc0ti.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/MmUQVkbQKVfQT8V2ItM5Y3wqaM0uzRzpbI6RnFAXYLTL4sjxMcvZGrHtNTp3plKn/n/idem3zoqc0ti/b/genaiagent-service-stack/o/genaiagent-solution-accelerator-quickstart.zip) to your local machine.
2. In the navigation bar of the Console, choose a region that hosts Generative AI Agents, for example, US Midwest (Chicago). If you don't know which region to choose, see [Regions with Generative AI Agents](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai-agents/overview.htm#regions).
3. Open the navigation menu and click Developer Services. Under Resource Manager, click Stacks.
4. Choose a compartment that you have permission to work in.
5. Click Create stack.
6. For the origin of the Terraform configuration, click My Configuration.
7. Under Stack Configuration, click .Zip file and then browse to or drop the prerequisite zip file from step 1 into the provided area.
8. Keep Custom providers unselected.
9. (Optional) Give the stack a name and description.
10. Choose Terraform version 1.2.x.
11. Click Next.
12. For openid_url, enter [your identity domain URL](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai-agents/getting-started.htm#prereq-domain). Example URL: `https://idcs-xxxxxxx.identity.oraclecloud.com`.
13. Keep the rest of the defaults and click Next.
14. Click Run apply.
15. Click Create.

## 1. Create data sources

We will generate some data points for our use case: we want to have **healthcare patient records** with some information from their previous visits. This is information we will give our LLM access to, through our Generative AI Agent, and ask the Agent questions about our patient records - this shows that even if the LLM hasn't trained for solving a specific type of prompt or query, RAG can facilitate this data *instantaneously* to the agent.

To generate data, we will go into our Conda environment and install Python dependencies to produce this data:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After, we can run `data_generator.py`:

```bash
cd scripts/
python data_generator.py
```

The console will ask for how many synthetic users' data you want. For testing purposes, this can be any small value that will let us test; for your own use case in practice, your only job is to select which data will go into the vector database, and in which form (JSON, structured data, raw text... and their properties (if any)).

Finally, we need to run `data_converter.py` to convert the data source into expected OCI OpenSearch format. From the docs, this is the expected format for a JSON Object:

```json
{"index": {}}
{"title": "", "body": "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Documentation\nAll Pages\nSkip to main content\nKnown Issues for Compute\nKnown issues have been identified in Compute...", "url": "https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/known-issues.htm"}
```

For that, we just have to execute the following script, making sure that there's a file called `data/generated_data.json` in your `data/` directory:

```bash
python data_converter.py
```

This will generate `data/opensearch_data.json`, in the proper format for OCI OpenSearch. Now that we have our data properly-formatted, we can create these data sources.




Now that we have our synthetic data ready, we can create these data sources in OpenSearch.

## 2. Create endpoint to consume data

## 3. Create agent to point to data source and identity domain

## 4. Talk to your new agent
