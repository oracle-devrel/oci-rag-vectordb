- [OCI Retrieval-Augmented Generations (RAG) with Generative AI Agents Service](./README_rag.md)
- [OCI RAG: Automation & ORDS](./README_ords.md)

Both guides are working with RAG in one way or the other. It's recommended to first take a look at **OCI Retrieval-Augmented Generations (RAG) with Generative AI Agents Service** as it also talks about deploying the required infrastructure in OCI.

The second solution (**OCI RAG: Automation & ORDS**) assumes you've deployed the infrastructure from the first solution.
